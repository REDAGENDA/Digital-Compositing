#This is details about Gamma
*What is Gamma?
'''
  {
  These informations were from
  ("http://www6.uniovi.es/hypgraph/color/gamma_correction/gamma_intro.html")
  *Gamma correction matters if you have any interest in displaying an image accurately on a computer screen. 
  *Gamma correction controls the overall brightness of an image. 
  *Images which are not properly corrected can look either bleached out, or too dark. Trying to reproduce colors accurately also requires some knowledge of gamma.
  *Varying the amount of gamma correction changes not only the brightness, but also the ratios of red to green to blue.

'''
*What is Linear Workflow?
'''
  {
  These informations were from
  ("https://www.cineversity.com/wiki/Linear_Workflow/")
  *Linear Workflow relates to the image and render pipeline, and how input imagery (typically textures and backgrounds) are processed by the rendering engine, and how the rendering engine applies adjustments to the final resulting images and movie files.
  Following URLs are just for personal studies about "What is Linear Workflow?" and "How can I use it in Maya?".

##This is details about ACES.
*What is ACES?
'''
  {
  These informations were from 
  ("https://blog.frame.io/2019/09/09/guide-to-aces/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_Pv4SdDFlo44XCqptA4TVmvufsCRr_.I9qqgxnT72maM-1632470937-0-gqNtZGzNAeWjcnBszQi9")
  ("oscars.org/science-technology/sci-tech-projects/aces")
  *As the industry of VFX getting more complicated, they needed a standard Color Space which will bring coherence to their workflow and the oupput. This is why the ACES was made.
  *ACES is the industry standard for managing color throughout the life cycle of a motion picture or television production.

'''
*What is Scene Referred data & Display Referred data?
'''
  {
  These informations were from
  ("https://www.lightspace.lightillusion.com/aces_overview.html")
  *Display Referred means images being manipulated are restricted/transformed into the color space of the display which we use to perform the data. 
  *Scene Referred simply means the image data is maintained in a format that as closely as possible represents the original scene, without effective restriction on colour or dynamic range.

###This is details about Premultification.
*What is Premult(Premultification)?
'''
  {
  These informations were from
  ("https://vfxcomp.tumblr.com/post/133669328626/i-understand-premultification")
  *Premultifying means Masking(Basicly).

'''
*What is the difference between normal image and pre-multiplied image?
'''
  {
  *The difference between those two is that even though they have the same alpha channel, premultiplied image's color channel has been multiplied with the alpha channel.
  }
'''
*What is the difference between straight work flow and premul
 '''
  {
  These informations were from
  ("https://www.provideocoalition.com/alpha-channels-premultiplied-vs-straight/")
  ("https://compositing.wordpress.com/2010/09/13/premultiply-unpremultiply/")
  ("https://www.cgdirector.com/premultiplied-alpha-vs-straight-alpha/")
  *With straight (or unmatted) channels, transparency information is stored only in the alpha channel, not in any of the visible color channels. With straight channels, the results of transparency arenâ€™t visible until the image is displayed [and interpreted correctly] in an application that supports straight channels.
  *With premultiplied (or matted) channels, transparency information is stored in the alpha channel and also in the visible RGB channels, which are multiplied with a background color. Premultiplied channels are sometimes said to be matted with color. The colors of semitransparent areas, such as feathered edges, are shifted toward the background color in proportion to their degree of transparency.
  *A premultiplied images is an image that has the RGB multiplied by the alpha channel.
