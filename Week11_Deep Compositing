#This is a report about Deep Compositing.
=============

#What is Deep Composting?
'''
  {
  Info from
  ("https://learn.foundry.com/nuke/content/comp_environment/deep/deep_compositing.html")
  Deep Compositing uses additonal depth data to solve problems.
  A standard 2D image contains a single data for each pixels. On the other hand, deep image contains multipel data per a pixel which contains color, opacity, and the camera relative depth.
